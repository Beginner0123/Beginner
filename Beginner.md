 >> <H2>WHY SITHUB ?
<em> 	WE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED IT BECAUSE SILICON DOESNT HAVE ANY PLATFORM WHERE STUDENT CAN GET NEWS OR CLUB EVENT FOR IT THEY USE WHASTAPP AND MANY MORE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM .<br>
		BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM THERE ARE MANY CLUB AND THEY HAVE  DIFFERENT PLATFORM AND PAGES
	<br>SO HERE'S THE SOLUTION WE MADE A WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN GET EVERY INFO ABOUT EVERY EVENT HAPPENING IN SILICON IN THIS WEBSITE. <br> EVERYTHING WILL ADDED IN THE SINGLE PAGE
</em>
